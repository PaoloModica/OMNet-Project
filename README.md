# OMNet-Project

This is an OMNet++ project developed in the context of the class of "Reti per l'Automazione Industriale" (Industrial Automation Networks) from the Master Degree Course in Computer Engineering at University of Catania.

This project implements a simulation model of a network of wireless transceivers working in the range of 915 MHz, based on the simulation model of the Physical Layer of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard protocol, available in the OMNet++ framework INETMANET.

TRANSCEIVER REQUIREMENTS:

1. Working band: 915 MHz;
2. Datarate: configurable (default: 250 kbps);
3. Header and CRC of the PHY Layer Frame: configurable (default: 9 byte);
4. It is possible to simulate transmissions on N wireless channels (N is configurable).
